        <h4>Chocolate cupcakes are the ultimate party food. These are super moist and bursting with rich, chocolaty flavor — and they're so easy to make. Frost these delicious chocolate cupcakes with buttercream or cream cheese frosting, or try royal icing or even whipped cream.</h4>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cocoa Powder - Of course, chocolate cupcakes need chocolate flavor. Use unsweetened cocoa powder for the most chocolatey results.</li>
            <li>Flour - All-purpose flour will work best for these chocolate cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Sugar - One and ½ cups will be the perfect amount of sugar to sweeten these cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Butter - Make sure your butter is softened for easy beating.</li>
            <li>Vanilla - Vanilla extract adds a hint of sweetness to these decadent cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Eggs - You'll need two eggs to bind the batter together for this recipe.</li>
            <li>Milk - Milk ensures the cupcakes stay moist.</li>
            <li>Leavening agents - Use both baking powder and baking soda for the perfect rise on these cupcakes.</li>
            <li>Salt - A little bit of salt adds a nice depth of flavor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make Chocolate Cupcakes</strong> - Making homemade chocolate cupcakes is so much easier than you would expect. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect from this simple recipe:

                Sift the dry ingredients (except the sugar) together. Cream the butter and sugar together. Then add the eggs and vanilla. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and milk. Beat until well combined. Spoon batter into prepared cupcake cups — only fill the cups ¾ of the way full so they don't overflow in the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Frost as desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Decorate Chocolate Cupcakes</strong> - You can really decorate these chocolate cupcakes anyway your heart desires. We love topping them with buttercream, cream cheese frosting, chocolate ganache, or simply whipped cream. Dress these chocolate cupcakes up even more with sprinkles or other garnishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Store Chocolate Cupcakes</strong> - Store chocolate cupcakes in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days.<li>
        </ol>
